            <p>This was a three and a half year project starting from 01 March 2012 to 30 June 2016. Led by Professor David Pym from
              UCL, it is categorised under Fundamentals of Computing and Computer Systems & Architectures.<sup>1</sup></p>

            <p>It’s main idea is about resource: efficient memory/file management and processor work-time to ensure a healthy and
              sustainable functioning system. Programmers dedicate resources all the time when allocating memory to variables.
            </p>

            <p>The research team believes that there can be a new kind of mathematical theory called 'resource reasoning', and that
              it should be considered before programming or system design starts.The aim is to develop new prototypes which could
              help eliminate frequent crashes and the mishandling of data, all to aid in the enhancement of system readability.<sup>2</sup></p>
            <p>
              The team has collaborated with researchers from other institutions to release a number of valuable papers regarding this topic:<sup>3</sup></br>

              The results developed in this project are used in a diverse range of areas and are applied to security policies in human-centred organizations. Now, the researchers involved in this project are working for industry-leading companies like Amazon,
              Facebook and Google.

            Compositional Security Analysis for Binaries

              <p>This project started on 26 November 2013 and ended on 25 November 2016. The research team, led by Professor Bryon
                Cook, consisted of researchers from University College London(UCL).<sup>[4]</sup> </p>

              <p>The project focuses on compositional analysis for binary code. What does this mean? Well, the research basically
                looks at how security is assessed at the binary level. This topic is in fact widely discussed among various groups
                such as the intelligence community, military organisations and security engineers.<sup>[4]</sup>
              </p>
              <p>
                Since binaries are usually very large, relevant analysis and verification techniques must be scalable.<sup>[4]</sup> The goal of this project
                was to develop new techniques for testing security at the binary level.</p>

              <p>The UCL research team managed to develop such methods, testing their techniques with a running case study: the data
                sanitisation problem - removing sensitive information from a message so that the message can be distributed to
                a broader audience.<sup>[4]</sup></p>

              <p>
                The UCL team had released a series of academic papers regarding the specific areas under this topic:</br>

              <p>This topic appears highly interesting to many researchers. Other universities in the UK like the University of Kent,
                Imperial College London, and Queen Mary University of London were also working on this area and have released
                publications which have pushed the development of this research area forward.<sup>[5]</sup> Now, this method of analysis has
                been adapted and used in industries where security levels are assessed.

                Have you ever looked at someone else's code and had know idea what it meant? This project aimed to help resolve this issue.</p>
              <p>
                The research group collaborated with organisations like Google and Microsoft with the goal to develop software that allows security
                engineers to get familiar with programs that were not coded by themselves.<sup>[6]</sup> The method will even point out possible
                flaws in the programs and advise engineers on where to fix or improve the problems.<sup>[6]</sup>
