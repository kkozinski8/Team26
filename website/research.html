            <p>This is a four-year project starting from 01 March 2012 to 30 June 2016. Led by Professor D from University College
              London, it is categorised under fundamentals of computing and computer systems & architectures.</p>

            <p>It’s main idea is about resource. Resource has always been a crucial aspect to be considered for all computer programmes
              and systems. Suitable and efficient usages of recourses such as memory, files, processor time must be ensured for
              healthy and sustainable working of systems. Thus it is natural for programmers to consider thoroughly about how
              the system deals with and allocates resource. The research team believes that there can be a new kind of mathematical
              theory, that is called resource reasoning, which connects closely with engineers' informal thinking about resources.
            </p>

            <p>The research team believes that resource should be considered not only in pre-formal system design, but the formal
              analysis and verification of programs as well now and in future. Undoubtedly, it is difficult to develop a mature
              theory (or theories) that both engages with their informal hunches, and generates tractable, reliable analysis and
              verification techniques for many problem. The research aimed new theoretical facts and new prototypes which which
              could help to eliminate frequent crash, mishandling of data and to enhance reliability.</p>
            <p>
              The team has collaborated with researchers from other institutions to release a number of valuable paper regarding this topic:</br>

              The results developed in this project are used for new projects in diverse areas and are applied in security policies in human-centred
              organizations. The researchers involved in this projects are now working for big companies like Amazon, Facebook
              and Google. They might fuse these ideas to their R&amp;D to impact more areas.

            Compositional Security Analysis for Binaries

              <p>This project started on 26 November 2013 and ended on 25 November 2016. The research team led by Professor B Cook
                consisted researchers from University College London(UCL). </p>

              <p>This project focus on compositional analysis for binary code. Binaries are commonly studied by various groups such
                as the intelligence community, military organisations and security engineers. Their vulnerabilities are widely
                discussed. Binaries are usually huge thus relevant analysis and verification techniques must be scalable. The
                scientific challenge in this research is the method to separate sophisticated interactions, prevent expensive
                operations, and derive procedure summaries which are solid.</p>

              <p>The UCL research team developed basic techniques to conduct the analysis, testing their viability with a running
                case study: the data sanitization problem. Confidential data is sanitised when its memory is zeroed before it
                is deallocated, preventing an attacker retrieving the sensitive information. </p>

              <p>
                Along their studies, the UCL team had released a series of academic papers regarding the specific areas under this topic:</br>

              <p>This topic appears highly interesting to many researchers. Other universities in UK like University of Kent, Imperial
                College London, and Queen Mary, University of London were also working on this aspect and have released publications
                which influence and push the development of this research field. Now, this method of analysis has been adapted
                and used in industries.

                as ‘Information and Communication Technology’.</p>

              <p>The project collaborated with industries like Google and Microsoft, aiming to develop an automatic program verification
                method that allows security engineers to get familiar with softwares that were not coded by themselves. The method
                will even point out possible flaws in the program and advise engineers on where to fix or improve by ‘discover
                logical descriptions of execution environments (preconditons, protocols, invariants, etc.) that pinpoint the assumptions
                necessary for code safety or those that trigger violations’.</p>

                and Communication Technology’.</p>

              <p> Current programming method is error-prone when dealing with multiprocessor systems. One PostgreSQL bug is caused
                by this issue and is hard to reproduce or observe. Bugs like this can hardly be detected in tests, therefore the
                research team wanted to invent an automated techniques that analyse the code without executing it with partial
                order semanics, freeing programmers from writing proofs for their code.</p>
